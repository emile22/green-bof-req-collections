1.  Introduction

   This memo extracts and groups requirements from the drafts which
   provided material [GREEN-BOF], [sustainability-insights],
   [legacy-path] and [rfc6988bis-green] to the green BoF.  The aim is to
   determine initial sets of requirements actionable at different levels
   of the framework [last-charter].

   The tables below respect the format and the semantic of operators
   requirements table of [last-charter].
