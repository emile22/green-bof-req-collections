Abstract

   This memo extracts and groups requirements from the revisit of
   operator's requirements made in the last charter refinement work and
   from the drafts which provided material to the green BoF.  The aim is
   to determine initial sets of requirements actionable at different
   levels of the framework.

1.  Introduction

   This memo extracts and groups requirements from the revisit of
   operator's requirements made in the last charter refinement work
   [charter-refinement] and from the drafts which provided material
   [GREEN-BOF], [sustainability-insights], [legacy-path] and
   [rfc6988bis-green] to the green BoF.  The aim is to determine initial
   sets of requirements actionable at different levels of the framework
   presented in [charter-refinement].

   The tables below respect the format and the semantic of operators
   requirements table of [charter-refinement].

2.  Operator'requirements from [charter-refinement] document

   The table below is a copy of the operator'requirements table of
   [charter-refinement].  They are based on the inputs received from
   operators for the GREEN BoF [operators-inputs].

6.1.  Inventory and Discovery

   Based on the framework discussed during the BoF, the architectural
   requirements for the “GREEN” Framework:

   From a Network Inventory [network-inventory]
   [I-D.draft-ivy-network-inventory-yang]
   [I-D.draft-palmero-opsawg-ps-almo-00] point of view, when discussing
   Energy Efficiency metrics, also known as GREEN metrics, it is
   important to distinguish between static and dynamic attributes:

   “Static” attributes refer to those that do not change based on the
   state of the network infrastructure.  The following examples are all
   static attributes that we can relate to the inventory, implemented in
   the network devices or as part of external sources:

   *  Serial number

   *  Product name

   *  Part number

   *  Vendor

   *  Device family

   *  Sensor(s)

   Static attributes also include benchmarking information related to
   energy consumption by design and test conditions, normally associated
   to PSU’s, line-cards, etc.:

   *  Idle power

   *  Max power

   *  Typical power

   *  Accuracy rate

   *  PSU efficiency (80+)

   *  Power allocation

   *  Etc.

   These attributes might be collected from the device/component itself
   or they might be parameters as part of external sources, i.e.,
   databases owned by the hardware or software providers, where API
   access will be preferred.

   Normally, the “Discovery” process will be updating static attributes
   that represent the up-to-date inventory of the network.  The
   Discovery process relates primarily to the static attributes, where
   will consider if a device or component has been replaced or is out of
   service.  The “Operation” process will be updating the so-called
   dynamic attributes.

   Dynamic attributes are those that are subject to change due to the
   running operations, including configuration and state changes, and
   they will need to be collected regularly.

   They will be updated as part of the regular operations.  Dynamic
   attributes might be related to sensors(environmental), traffic,
   state, etc.  They will include attributes like:

   *  Temperature

   *  Current

   *  Voltage

   *  Power

   *  Input and output traffic

   The data collection frequency might need to be adjusted based on the
   specific attributes.  For example, the discovery of linecards
   installed on network devices will not change every hour, whereas
   temperature and power sensor information changes will need to be
   closer to real-time.

   Even though sensors normally are embedded in the network device/
   component, there are external sensors meant to measure temperature
   and energy consumption.  The network controller will need to collect
   and correlate information to compose the right GREEN metric for the
   network device/component.

  a collection of data for network devices and their components managed by a specific management system.

   not been found.
