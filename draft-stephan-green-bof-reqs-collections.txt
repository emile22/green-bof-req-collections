Abstract

   This memo extracts and groups requirements from the revisit of
   operator's requirements made in the last charter refinement work and
   from the drafts which provided material to the green BoF.  The aim is
   to determine initial sets of requirements actionable at different
   levels of the framework.

1.  Introduction

   This memo extracts and groups requirements from the revisit of
   operator's requirements made in the last charter refinement work
   [charter-refinement] and from the drafts which provided material
   [GREEN-BOF], [sustainability-insights], [legacy-path] and
   [rfc6988bis-green] to the green BoF.  The aim is to determine initial
   sets of requirements actionable at different levels of the framework
   presented in [charter-refinement].

   The tables below respect the format and the semantic of operators
   requirements table of [charter-refinement].
